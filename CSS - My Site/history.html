      <p>This is where the "Father of EEG", German scientist Hans Berger comes onto the scene. He is the one who put pen to paper. (And, notably, not a Nazi. Yay!)</p>
        <img src="images/hans.jpeg" alt="Photo of Hans Berger"><br />In 1924, he recorded the first human EEG. In Germany, he was visited by a young Grey Walter.<br />
